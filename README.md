# Smart Patrol Bot

Project Proposed for Project-Exhibition-1 Conducted by VIT BHOPAL UNIVERSITY

# 🤖 Smart Patrol Bot 
## 📌 Project Overview
The Smart Patrol Bot is an autonomous mobile surveillance system designed to enhance security by integrating motion detection, live video streaming, and smart navigation. It utilizes PIR sensors for motion and intrusion detection, an ESP32-CAM module for real-time video streaming and image capture, and Python Flask for object/person detection. The bot navigates autonomously using a chassis with wheels and motors controlled by an L298N motor driver, and it provides alerts and notifications to the user in case of suspicious activity, offering a cost-effective and intelligent solution for surveillance.

## 🌟 Features
1. Detects motion and intrusions using PIR sensors.
2. Provides real-time surveillance through the ESP32-CAM for video streaming and image capture.
3. Detects objects and persons using Python Flask to identify and track.
4. Navigates autonomously around premises using a chassis with wheels and motors controlled by an L298N motor driver.
5. Sends alerts and notifications, including images, to the owner or user in case of suspicious activity.
6. Offers a cost-effective and efficient surveillance solution.
Operates independently without constant human intervention.
